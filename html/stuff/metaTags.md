# Meta Tags

The behind-the-scenes stuff that makes your page work properly. Not flashy, but essential.

## Core Meta Tag

**Meta** `<meta>`  
Self-closing tag that provides extra info about your webpage. Goes in the `<head>` section.

Common attributes:
- `charset="UTF-8"` - character encoding
- `name` and `content` - key-value pairs for page info
- `viewport` - for responsive design

## Page Identity

**Favicon** `<link rel="icon">`  
That little icon in the browser tab. Usually a .ico or .png file.

**Base URL** `<base>`  
Sets the default URL for all relative links on the page. Your team's home base for navigation.
