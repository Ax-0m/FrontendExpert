# Semantics

HTML tags that give meaning to your content structure. Like having proper team roles instead of just throwing everyone in a lane.

## Content Structure

**Article** `<article>`  
Self-contained content that makes sense on its own. Blog posts, news articles, comments.

**Section** `<section>`  
Thematic grouping of related content. Not standalone like article.

**Main** `<main>`  
The primary content of the page. One per page only - your main carry.

## Navigation & Layout

**Header** `<header>`  
Introductory content for a page or section. Usually contains headings, logos, nav.

**Nav** `<nav>`  
Section containing navigation links. Your team's map movement.

**Footer** `<footer>`  
Bottom section with metadata, copyright, contact info.

## Supporting Content

**Aside** `<aside>`  
Content related to main content but not essential. Sidebars, ads, related links. Page works fine without it.
