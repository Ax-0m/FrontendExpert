# Semantics

- <article> -> Self-Contained, independently distributable content.
- <section> -> Thematic grouping of content, not self-contained.
- <header> -> Introductory content.
- <main> -> Main content, limited to one per page.
- <nav> -> A section of links, oftentimes for the primary navigation of the page.
- <aside> -> Non-vital content indirectly related to the main content. The page would make sense without this content.
- <footer> -> Footer of the document, oftentimes containing copyright information.
