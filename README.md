# ðŸ§  My Frontend Learning Journey â€“ From Bronze to Challenger

Hey there! Welcome to my personal frontend bootcamp where I'm trying to remember how to code without AI carrying me every game.

*Fair warning: I'm a League jungler so there might be some LoL references here and there. The coding explanations work fine without them though!*

## What's this all about?

So... I've been letting AI do most of my coding lately, and my React skills have gotten pretty rusty. Kind of like when you're autofilled ADC and realize you forgot how to last hit.

Time to get back in the jungle and clear some camps properly before I int another interview.

This is basically my study notes and practice repo where I'm:
- Learning my jungle pathing (the fundamentals) 
- Actually clearing camps with my own hands (building things)
- Making sure I can shot-call properly (explain what I'm doing)

Think of it as my personal practice tool, but for frontend skills instead of perfecting my Graves combos.

## What you'll find here

I'm slowly adding:
- **HTML/CSS practice** â€“ getting back to basics
- **JavaScript exercises** â€“ events, DOM manipulation, async stuff
- **React projects** â€“ hooks, state management, components
- **Small builds** â€“ things that actually work (hopefully)
- **Interview prep** â€“ because apparently I need it

## Why am I doing this?

Because blanking on `useEffect` in an interview feels like missing smite on Baron and watching the enemy team take it.

I want to be able to:
- Code without constantly alt-tabbing to Stack Overflow
- Actually understand my builds (code) instead of just following guides
- Carry conversations about my code instead of getting hard camped by questions

## My approach

Working through FrontendExpert, building random stuff, and taking notes along the way. Solo queue all the way â€“ no duo partner this time, just me grinding through the jungle until I hit my power spike.

---

## Bottom line

Trying to climb the ladder and get my skills back up to where they should be. If you're also stuck in elo hell with your coding, feel free to follow along or use anything that helps.

Let's see if I can avoid getting jungle diffed this time.

GLHF!
